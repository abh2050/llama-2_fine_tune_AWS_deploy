        "content": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when separated by large distances. When particles are entangled, measuring one particle instantly affects the state of its entangled partner, regardless of the distance between them. This 'spooky action at a distance' (as Einstein called it) has been experimentally verified and is fundamental to quantum computing and quantum cryptography."

The iterative approach is generally more efficient for large numbers as it avoids recursion overhead."

Eventually, the child learns to identify cats and dogs in new pictures they've never seen before. Machine learning works similarly:\n\n1. **Training**: Feed the computer lots of data with known answers\n2. **Learning**: The computer finds patterns in this data\n3. **Prediction**: The computer uses these patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data\n\nCommon examples:\n- Email spam filters learn from examples of spam vs. legitimate emails\n- Recommendation systems learn from your viewing/buying history\n- Voice assistants learn to understand speech patterns\n- Medical AI learns from thousands of medical scans to help diagnose diseases\n\nThe 'magic' is that the computer discovers these patterns automatically, without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario."
